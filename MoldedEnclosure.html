    This project started from a concept for a local start-up. The engagement with the start-up didn't go through but I decided to take the concept further in order to learn more about injection molding design. <br><i> Note: No confidential details regarding either the start-up or their product have been included. </i>
  </p>
  <p>
    The goal of this project is to create a custom waterproof enclosure that can be used to store electronics for floating applications.
  </p>
  <p>Features that I'm exploring:
    <ol>
      <li>Molding a full enclosure as a split half in order to use a single mold </li>
      <li>Introducing sufficient draft of 3-5 degrees to ensure </li>
      <li>Gasket design along the edges to ensure that water cannot enter </li>
      <li>Screw holes designed into the enclosure in order to allow proper sealing</li>
      <li>Anchor points on the outside to tie into various structures</li>
    </ol>
