        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Which ethereum address has the highest amount of USDC associated with it?</li>
                <li>What does the distribution of liquidity providers on uniswap look like? How about on sushiswap? And on curve.finance?</li>
                <li>How has the price for my favorite Art Blocks NFT changed over time?</li>
                <li>How many people own 0xdeafbeef's NFTs?</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            So many questions... although there are lots of people writing articles and creating dashboards to track these metrics, I've been curious to learn what it takes to answer some of these questions <em>on my own</em>. After all, isn't the point of a public, decentralized blockchain that me, as a member of the public, can answer any questions that I may have without relying on a central party? Or at least I should be able to verify that the data and analysis done by someone else aligns with how I'd approach the problem?
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm hoping a side benefit is that this excursion may allow me to better understand and appreciate how various smart contracts and blockchain protocols function under-the-hood.
        </p>
        <h2>Current Status</h2>
        <p>            
            Unsurprisingly, there seem to be many ways to approach this. The tool that I've started experimenting with is <a href="dune.xyz">Dune Analytics</a>, courtesy some tutorials by <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewhong5297">Andrew Hong</a>. Eventually, I'd like to learn about The Graph and even further down the road I'd like to see what it takes to query this stuff directly.
        </p>
        <p>
            dune.xyz seems to have a backend that is continuously adding data from ethereum (and a few other blockchains) into a SQL database that can then be queried using SQL.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, now I need to learn SQL, dune.xyz and the underlying smart contracts. Sounds like this is going to take some time :-)
