    This is a work-in-progress.
  </p>
  <p>

    The goal of this project is to create a working mechanical demonstration of Lissajous curves. The project idea popped up while reading about <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lissajous_curve">Lissajous figures</a> in A.P. French's Vibrations and Waves.
  </p>
  <p>
    Two independent sliders are designed to be driven by DC servo motors that are controlled by an Arduino. The sliders drive a central stage that can hold a pen which can mark on paper. By varying the ratio of the rotational speeds, a variety of Lissajous curves can be obtained.
  </p>
  <p>
    An additional design constraint has been to spend as little as possible on this project and so most materials (except for the Arduino and DC servo's) are either scrap or 3D-printed. The rods were obtained for under $15 from the Home Depot.
  </p>
  <p>
   Currently, I'm focused on designing 3D printed linear bearings that are compliant and have the exact degrees of freedom needed to allow smooth movement without binding.
