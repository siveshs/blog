        <p>Hello, Iâ€™m Sivesh. </p>
        <p>Iâ€™m a thirty-something human that enjoys designing and making things.</p>
        <p>I work as a mechanical engineer at Apple by day (and the occasional night ðŸ˜‰).</p>
        <p>Outside of work, I read, meet friends, hike, grow indoor plants, dabble in generative art, look at crypto prices and occasionally practise yoga and meditate.</p>
        <p>My dad introduced me to Basic on an old IBM thinkpad in the late 90s. Since then, Iâ€™ve always enjoyed tinkering with code. Itâ€™s kind of an addiction. I canâ€™t stop watching youtube videos, scrolling endlessly through hacker news and thinking about all the programming languages I have yet to learn.</p>
        <p>This website is an attempt to stop scrolling, document my plans and keep tabs on progress.</p>
        <p>Itâ€™s also a project of its own. Iâ€™ve never built a website before and for some reason I think it should be easy.</p>
        <p>I guess weâ€™ll see...</p>
