  <h1> About this website </h1>

    <i>"Real artists ship."</i>
  </h2>
  <p>
    This website is a means to obtain closure for the projects that I work on from time-to-time. My hope is that having this outlet will be additional motivation to take these projects to their logical conclusions.
  </p>
  <p>
    If, in the process, I'm able to create tools or ideas that eventually inspire someone else to create something even better, then that would be simply superb.
