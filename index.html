            <h3>Hello, I’m Sivesh</h3>
            <p>
                I’m a thirty-something human that enjoys designing and making
                things.
            </p>
            <p>
                I work as a mechanical engineer by day (and the occasional
                night).
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of work, I read, meet friends, hike, grow indoor plants,
                dabble in generative art, look at crypto prices and occasionally
                practise yoga and meditate.
            </p>
            <p>
                My dad introduced me to Basic on an old IBM thinkpad in the late
                90s. Since then, I’ve always enjoyed tinkering with code.

                This website is an attempt at sharing some of what I've made and
                learned.
