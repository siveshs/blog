  <h1> Command-line tool for viewing STL files </h1>
  <h2> 04/26/2016 </h2>
  <p> This is a work-in-progress. </p>

  <p>
    Visualization of data and objects in 2D, 3D and VR is something that I'm currently fascinated with. Combining that with an urge to discover and contribute to the power of open-source, I've decided to make a command-line based STL viewer. There are likely many of these already out there, but my goal is to get comfortable with developing for the UNIX command-line.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here's the rundown of my approach:
    <ol>
      <li> Render simple ASCII STL files</li>
      <li> Render binary ASCII STL files </li>
      <li> Implement simple interactions with the model (Not sure if I'll get to this one but it's worth having a stretch goal)</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <p>
    In the process, I'm hoping to start getting comfortable with shell-scripting, C and GNUPlot. Some basic familiarity with git and make is also expected. Suggestions on different frameworks or tools to use to display 3D graphics are welcome.
