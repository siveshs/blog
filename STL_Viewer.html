  <h1> Command-line tool for viewing STL files </h1>

    Succesfully managed to create a shell-script to parse ASCII STL files and render them in 3D using GNUPlot!
  </p>
  <p>
    The script is actually incredibly simple and used AWK to parse the raw ASCII file into a format that is suitable for GNUPlot. GNUPlot then simply plots it. </p>

  <p>
    As can be seen in the image, I still need to figure out how to get GNUPlot to scale the axes correctly. Also, there are a lot of internal lines connecting the triangles. This seems to be due to GNUPlot's tendency to create isolines between datablocks. These seem relatively simple to fix in the future so I'm going to switch tracks to figuring out how to parse binary files.

  Source code for stlgp-ascii is available at <a href="https://github.com/siveshs/stlgp"> https://github.com/siveshs/stlgp </a>

  <h2> 04/26/2016 </h2>
  <p> This is a work-in-progress. </p>

  <p>
    Visualization of data and objects in 2D, 3D and VR is something that I'm currently fascinated with. Combining that with an urge to discover and contribute to the power of open-source, I've decided to make a command-line based STL viewer. There are likely many of these already out there, but my goal is to get comfortable with developing for the UNIX command-line.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here's the rundown of my approach:
    <ol>
      <li> Render simple ASCII STL files</li>
      <li> Render binary ASCII STL files </li>
      <li> Implement simple interactions with the model (Not sure if I'll get to this one but it's worth having a stretch goal)</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <p>
    In the process, I'm hoping to start getting comfortable with shell-scripting, C and GNUPlot. Some basic familiarity with git and make is also expected. Suggestions on different frameworks or tools to use to display 3D graphics are welcome.
